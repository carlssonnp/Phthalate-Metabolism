# Phthalate-Metabolism
Authors: Yaghjyan L, Carlsson NP, Ghita GL, Chang SH

In this project, associations of individual and lifestyle characteristics with Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) metabolism were investigated using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2001-2012. My roles included data cleaning/transformation, data analysis, and manuscript revision. All of my analyses were performed using SAS, with the primary means of analysis being multiple linear regression, taking into account the complex sampling design of the NHANES survey.
